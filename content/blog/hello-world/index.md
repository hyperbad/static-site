I started this site as a way to keep up my technical chops in my personal time (can I still code?) and have central site that I _owned_. LinkedIn, etc are fine but I like a little more control over my internet presence. Who doesn't want to be a webmaster in 2020? I'm a bit of a masochist in that way ...

On to Technical Stuff!

I'm using a static site builder using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hosting the content with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Jeckyll is the better supported generator for Github Pages, but I specifically wanted to get my hands dirty with Gatsby.
After some false starts, I found [this tutoria](https://jarednielsen.com/deploy-gatsbyjs-github-pages-user/) which helped me figure out the branching bit. I'll be working on this slowly but surely.
Oh, using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit.
